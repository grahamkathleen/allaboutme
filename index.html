            <h2>Photos</h2>
            <p>As you can see, Kathleen enjoys family, social events and living in the fast lane. Riding a waverunner on any sunny day out in the Columbia River is her way of enjoying life. Her family is large with 6 children and 12 Grandchildren but it doesn't stop there since so many of the kids friends feel right at home with her as their second Mom.
              Check out these photos for more on Kathleen's homelife and lifestyle. You will see that her life is busy. Holidays involve large parties and hosting family events. These events are fun and rewarding sometimes cooking for as many as eighteen people.
